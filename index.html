            <div class="mediacontent">As part of my coursework this semester, I completed five worksheets. Prior to starting the worksheets, despite the fact that I have previous programming experience from my Computer Science A-Level, I was a complete amateur at html due to how different it is from more traditional programming languages such as Python or JavaScript. Using the worksheets, I managed to go from a complete beginner who couldn’t even write a single line of html to a novice website developer familiar with the basics of both html5 and CSS. <br><br>
                The first worksheet taught me how to set up a html file and how to publish it to GitHub, as well as how to navigate Visual Studio Code (VSC). A particularly useful feature of VSC which I discovered through the worksheets is the ability to split the window in half to show multiple files at once, which ended up being very useful for seeing how my html and CSS files were interacting. <br><br>
                The second and third worksheets guided me in creating two webpages about pizza and cake. These two worksheets helped me become familiar with the core concepts of html and CSS, such as how lists and images work, as well as classes within CSS. I used the third worksheet in particular as reference for setting up sections in the website you’re reading right now. <br><br>
                The fourth and fifth worksheets guided me in creating the webpage “Flexbox Rundown”. The fourth worksheet taught me how to use lists to create a navigation bar in the header. However, one issue I found with this method is that, by default, clickable list items become blue and underlined, which doesn’t fit in with the visual design of most websites. To overcome this issue, I set “text-decoration” for all list items to be “none”. In worksheet five, the concept of buttons are introduced, so if I were to do this project again I’d use buttons instead of clickable list items as they appear to be much more powerful and designed for navigation.  <br><br>
                Overall, I found the worksheets to be a helpful way of teaching myself the basics of html and CSS, particularly how flexbox works.
